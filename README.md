### Manual Install

The Easy Way: our install script for bench will install all dependencies (e.g. MariaDB).

New passwords will be created for the ERPChain "Administrator" user, the MariaDB root user, and the frappe user (the script displays the passwords and saves them to ~/frappe_passwords.txt).

> Login for the PWD site: (username: Administrator, password: admin)
